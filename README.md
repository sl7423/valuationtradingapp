# Valuation Trading App (Still Updating)

The purpose of this project is to build a trading app that uses a discounted cash flow model to value companies. The algorithm calculates a value for the company at the end of each month. If the market capitalization is greater than the value calculated by the discounted cash flow, then the stock will be sold. Typically

Django was used in the backend to render to portfolio results.

The discounted cash flow model is built, using inspiration from Professor Aswath Damodaran. The trading platform was built from using the ideas in Mayank Rasu's course in Algorithmic Trading & Quantitative Finance. Both of these figures have been inspirational in my development as an investor and a programmer.
